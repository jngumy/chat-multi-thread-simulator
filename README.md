# Multi thread chat simulator in Java

This is a final project for my University's Object-Oriented Programming subject depeveloped by Lucia G. , Ezequiel W. and me. Basically, it's  
a multi thread chat simulator project made in Java. The main idea was work
with the core concepts of OOP and Java language such as:

* Polymorphism
* Encapsulation
* Inheritance
* Abstraction
* Method overriding and Method overloading
* SOLID Design principles
* Design Patterns (GoF)
* Concurrency - Java Threads (Locks and Synchronization)
* Java Exceptions
* Java Serializer
* Java Swing and UI Layouts

We used design Patterns like Singleton, MVC, Observer-Observable, Template Method, Factory to solve different problems.
